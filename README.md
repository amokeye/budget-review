# Budget-Review

Budget Review tracks withdrawals and deposits that user inputs so that the user won't wonder where money is going to/coming from! Budget Review functions both online and offline to ensure that the user's balance is always accurate. When withdrawals or deposits are added while the user is offline, Budget Review will update the user's balance with those inputs when the user re-establishes online connection. Below is an example of the user interface for Budget review.
